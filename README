This repository contains the original docbooks from Sun's last drop and
contains the process of converting them to a format that will work well
for illumos. Currently only a subset of the docbooks that once existed
are here. Others will be added once someone cares enough about them and
we make the process for working on them not quite so terrible.

To build them into something useful, first expect pain and then take a
look at http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+documentation/tools.
In case that too disappears (like the docbooks), I've included the
source to the Java build tool which is licensed (according to the
source) under a combo GPL/CDDL.

Building:

To build the currently existing docbooks, use the provided script. The
quick and easy way to build everything is to use:

./tools/build.sh -a

Layout:

You can find the original Sun docbooks under raw/.
You can find the tools to build them under tools/.
